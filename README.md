Pagemaster is a simple collection of tools for creating stories from json-formatted choose-your-own-adventure-type story content.  

toPdf.py
========
_toPdf.py_ is currently the only functional tool.  Run it on the json file to get an output pdf.  It requires all the images to be in the local directory.  It requires _pdflatex_ to be installed on the path.  

ex. ./toPdf.py story.json

TODO
====
### pdflatex
* add support for images
* add support for markup
